# Enjoy_research_and_survive
I've curated insights and advice from seasoned researchers on the subject of research, valuable for anyone venturing into this field, not just computer science students. If you have an interest in Computational Graphics (CG) or Computer Vision (CV), or are actively researching these areas, I invite you to explore and contribute to [my dedicated repository on CG and CV](https://github.com/jamesdemon923/Explore-graphics-and-vision). I hope you can gain a lot from these and survive in your research!
